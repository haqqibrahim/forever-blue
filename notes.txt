1. Niche into several areas
- Getting information of what research has been done based on the topic/context [sciencefair.io]
- Come up with 2 spinoff ideas to improve upon the past or exisitng research [sciencefair.io]
- spinoff project description in a bullet points [ sciencefair.io]
- suggest papers to read based on the spinoff

2. Install Mendeley
- For generating references and citations.

3. Put Each Area into SciSpace
- Search each of the bullet points from the spinoff project description, search for related papers [scispace]
- the papers should have: title, writer, date publised, publisher
- summarize the top 5 papers found.
- Each of the papers found: Generate 3 max bullet points as insights

4. Put Each Paper Paper into Mendeley
- Organize by type of paper into each folder

5. ChatPDF
- Read the Paper using ChatPDF
- Let the user describe his level of expertise, and the AI should answer the explain or respond based on the expertise

6. Paper Notes Templates
- Certain sections matter; sciencefair.io/guide
- the important parts the AI should explain but in summary: abstract -> intro -> Figures -> Conclusions
- Get into any remaining details (methods, results, supplementary, appendices, etc.)
- write 1 paragraph per source

7. Identify important papers and Mindmap Using Them
- Make a notes
